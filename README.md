I’m **Meshack Kwame Nartey**, a **Software Engineer** passionate about building impactful and user-centered solutions that address real-world challenges.  
Currently, I’m interning with **AmaliTech** as a **Backend Developer**, where I’m gaining hands-on experience in backend technologies, API design, and scalable software development.

I’ve worked on several projects involving **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **RESTful APIs**, including building a **console-based banking system**, designing a **car-tracking mobile app for campus**, contributing to **Paymii**, a crypto wallet platform, and developing **Shuttl Smart**, a system designed to optimize campus transportation.  

I’ve also conducted research on **Buddy Guard**, a project that explores innovative approaches to safety and monitoring solutions.  

Before focusing fully on software engineering, I worked as a **UI/UX Designer**, an experience that shaped my approach to development — blending functionality with intuitive user experience.  

I’m deeply passionate about **open-source collaboration**, **research**, and **creating technology that empowers individuals and communities** across Africa and beyond.
